# Keyphrase-Extraction-using-BERT
Here I have tried Keyphrase extraction from text using BERT. I've used a pytorch-pretrained-bert. The results came out to be very good. Validation loss: 0.09778740532972195 Validation Accuracy: 0.9691100823045266 Validation F1-Score: 0.40851315400532073. I have used google colab for this model and I would advise to use colab until you have a laptop with fairly good configuration.
